I've just realized that
sizeof(free_block_s) > sizeof(int) + sizeof(free_block_t)

Therefore, if we write seperately the int then the free_block_t of the
structure, then the system cannot read them again when using the C semantic.
(because the C language will read sizeof(free_block_s), and not
sizeof(int) + sizeof(free_block_t))

So, I think the teacher hasn't been really useful there. Yes, we don't have
to write 2 seperate functions to read and write, but NO, it's not as simple
as casting it to (int *) etc..

Though, using the function memcpy, it works great ! At least for the init.
